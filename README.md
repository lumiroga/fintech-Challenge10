This project is the tenth challenge for the Columbia Fintech Bootcamp.

This challenges is an introduction to Unsupervised Learning with clustering via KMeans algorithm, and PCA for reducing dimensions.

The data used is a set of Different Crypto Currencies with its  daily, weekly, monthly, change.

Data is included in [Daily Rate Sheet](./Resources/crypto_market_data.csv)

## Technologies

The main language is Python, with the following auxiliary modules/libraries.
Python version is 3.7, developed in an independent conda virtual environment

### pandas
This module handles DataFrames (dynamic tables), to maniupulate, store data, do automatic calculations and adding dynamic data.

### SKLearn
This modules contains Artificial Intelligence and Data Science tools, in this case KMeans (for the clustering algorithm), StandardScaler (Standarizes values based on Average and Standard deviation) and PCA (Dimension reduction algorithm to make processing more efficient)

### pathlib
This module helps abstracting the OS discrepancies between folder structures and files.
